# A Repository of DEST-related Supplementary Materials
**"Benchmark-Figures.zip"** stores the figures which plot the final solution sets obtained by DEST and other comparison algorithms on all text problems with the median IGD+ value among 30 runs.  
**"Boxplots-HV.zip"** and **"Boxplots-IGDp.zip"** store the figures which draw the box plots of IGD+ and HV values for DEST and other comparison algorithms among 30 runs on each instance of three regular benchmark suites.  
**"DEST-Code.rar"** stores the source code of DEST.  
**"Data.zip"** stores the IGDp and HV results for each run of DEST on all test problems.  
**"EqDTLZ.zip"** stores the source code of Eq-DTLZ benchmark suite.  
**"Paper-Figures.zip"** stores all figures in the paper, "A Diversity-Enhanced Tri-Stage Framework for Constrained Multi-objective Optimization".
